# GitHub Landing Page

## What This Project Is About
This is a GitHub landing page built with HTML and CSS3. I've created it to show how to build a modern, professional-looking website that looks great on phones, tablets, and computers. The page includes a nice hero section with big text and buttons, cards that show different features with cool hover effects, and a complete footer. Everything is styled with pure CSS. It's a great example of how to use flexbox and grid layouts to make responsive designs that work everywhere.
